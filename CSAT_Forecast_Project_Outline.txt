Project Outline: Time Series Forecasting of CSAT Scores

1. Data Preparation
   - Loaded Excel file with correct header row (row 5).
   - Parsed 'Call Timestamp' column as datetime and set it as index.

2. Time Series Aggregation
   - Resampled CSAT scores to daily averages for time series analysis.

3. Stationarity Check
   - Applied Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to verify stationarity.
   - Result: Time series is stationary (p-value < 0.05).

4. Model Selection and Forecasting
   - Used SARIMA model with parameters (1,0,1)x(1,0,1,7).
   - Forecasted CSAT scores for the next 30 days.

5. Output
   - Saved forecasted CSAT scores with confidence intervals to 'CSAT_Forecast_30_Days.csv'.
   - Visualized forecast with matplotlib (optional).
